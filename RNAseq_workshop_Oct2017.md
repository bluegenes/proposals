**Abstract**

Over the past 3 years, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) Bioinformatics User Group, and its umbrella organization, Open Data Science at SIO, have been developing and running training workshops to build bioinformatics knowledge and resources for students, faculty, staff, and community members at SIO, UCSD, and NOAA Southwest fisheries. Beyond providing training in scientific computing and data analysis, these workshops aim to build an open research community at SIO that shares information and facilitates collaboration. Access to sufficient computational resources is a barrier for students and researchers new to data-intensive biology, and has been a limitation for these workshops. This proposal requests computing resources on the IU/TACC Jetstream platform to support training in non-model RNAseq data analysis in October 2017. A week-long version of this workshop was successfully run in August 2017 as part of the Data-Intensive Biology Summer Institute at UC Davis (DIBSI), and it has been modified for a 2 day workshop from October 11-12, 2017, with 5 instructors. The workshop will train learners in a single non-model RNAseq workflow while providing materials and discussion for study design and analysis for specific RNAseq projects described by workshop participants. In addition to providing a computational resources for data analysis, the use of jetstream resources will enable researchers to gain familiarity with this platform before applying for their own startup allocations to utilize these resources for their future research. All materials are CC-BY, with scripts and associated code under BSD; the material is designed for Jetstream cloud usage and final materials, lectures, and discussion notes will be made available for future use.

**Resource Justification**

The RNA-Seq workshop will serve 35 people and have 5 instructors, and run for 2 days. As this workshop utilizes long-running, memory-intensive programs (e.g. Trinity transcriptome assembler), we request m1.medium VMs (6 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 60GB storage) with 24 hour/day usage, for a week total per person to allow for troubleshooting and bridge participants over to their own startup allocations. To facilitate large data analyses, we are also requesting an additional 100GB storage volume per person.

7 days x 24 hours/day x 6 vCPU x 40 participants = 40,320 SUâ€™s
100 GB storage x 40 students
